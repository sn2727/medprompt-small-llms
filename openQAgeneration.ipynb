The normal resting range for heart rate for adults is 60 to 80 beats per minute, and for blood pressure, it's less than 120/80 mm Hg. Your readings indicate a condition known as hypertension, which is a persistent high blood pressure.\n",

So, it is important to monitor and control it to prevent potential serious health issues like heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, or even vision loss.\n",

      "It's not a good idea to ignore hypertensive symptoms or assume that it'll go away on its own. The fact that your doctor has started you on a medication indicates that they believe it'd be beneficial in managing your blood pressure levels. However, lifestyles changes like regular exercise, a healthier diet, reducing sodium intake, limiting alcohol, quitting smoking, and maintaining a healthful weight can also significantly help in managin hypertensions.\n",
